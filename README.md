# assign.partners-model

### A partner-pairing app. (The model portion, anyway.)

`assign.partners` pairs work partners together. It has the following features:

* It manages multiple rosters.
* It tracks for each member of a roster how many times they've been paired with each other member.
* It randomly assigns partners from among a roster.
* It allows manual reassignment.


### Usage

assign.partners has an [API](https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/) for managing your roster(s).

**Endpoints**

GET /users/{id}/rosters

Returns the rosters for the given user.
